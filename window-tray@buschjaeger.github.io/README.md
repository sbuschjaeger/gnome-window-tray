# Window Tray

GNOME Shell extension: **minimize-to-tray for the apps you choose**, instead of
a workspace.

**GNOME Shell 50 · Wayland · X11 · GPL-2.0-only**

## Why not workspaces?

The GNOME mental model is one workspace per project. That works — until an app
belongs to no project: messaging, mail, calendar, monitoring. Those apps are not
*where you work*, they are *with you while you work*.

Giving them a permanent tray workspace means switching away from your project to
read a message, and it stops scaling after two or three apps. Leaving them
everywhere means they haunt the overview, Alt+Tab, and your window count.

Window Tray does what desktop OSes did for decades instead: minimize puts the
window in a **panel tray**, and activating the app brings that existing window to
**whichever workspace you are on**. Your workspace layout never changes and no
parking workspace is created.

## Behavior

- Minimizing a configured app's window adds a row (icon, title, close button) to
  the panel tray.
- Tray windows are hidden from the overview, Alt+Tab, taskbars, and pagers.
- Clicking a row moves that exact window to the current workspace and focuses it.
- Activating a configured app from the dash, app grid, a launcher (e.g.
  Vicinae), or its notification brings its existing window to the current
  workspace instead of switching you to it.
- **New window**, middle-click, and Ctrl+click keep their normal meaning.
- Intentional workspace moves (`Shift+Ctrl+Alt+←/→`, overview drag-and-drop) are
  never intercepted.
- The window close button, `File → Quit`, and `Alt+F4` are untouched: this
  extension reinterprets *minimize*, never *close*.
- Every minimized window gets its own row, so multi-window apps stay individually
  reachable.

Uses genuine Mutter minimized state plus temporary window-list suppression —
nothing is faked, and visibility is fully restored when an app is unconfigured or
the extension is disabled.

## Install

```sh
gnome-extensions install window-tray@buschjaeger.github.io.shell-extension.zip
```

Log out and back in (GNOME Shell only discovers new extensions at session start),
then:

```sh
gnome-extensions enable window-tray@buschjaeger.github.io
```

From the working tree: `./scripts/pack.sh --install`.

## Configure

```sh
gnome-extensions prefs window-tray@buschjaeger.github.io
```

Fastest: focus the app you want trayed, open Window Tray's preferences, choose
**Use last focused application**. Or add apps by desktop-ID prefix.

> Prefix matching means `firefox` also matches `firefox-browser`. Use the full
> desktop ID for an exact match.

Config lives in `~/.config/window-tray/config.json` and reloads live — no restart
after editing the app list.

## Known limitations

- **GNOME Shell 50 only.** Backports welcome.
- **Chromium/Brave PWAs and notifications.** Some PWAs (e.g. WhatsApp in Brave)
  publish notifications under the generic browser desktop ID, carrying no app
  information. Window Tray lets the browser resolve its own target, then
  recognizes a configured PWA by WM class / `crx_<id>` on focus and returns it to
  the workspace where the notification was clicked. It never guesses from window
  titles.
- A tray row's × sends a normal close *request*; apps may still veto.
- `skip-taskbar` windows (docks, panels, many notification windows) are never
  trayed.
- Tray membership is per session and not restored across reboots.

## Development

```
window-tray@buschjaeger.github.io/   extension.js · prefs.js · config.js · metadata.json · stylesheet.css · *.svg
scripts/pack.sh                      build (+ --install) the extension zip
scripts/watch-notifications.sh       log helper for notification issues
```

`config.js` and the SVG need explicit `--extra-source` flags for
`gnome-extensions pack`; `scripts/pack.sh` encodes that, because a zip missing
them fails on enable.

```sh
./scripts/pack.sh            # -> dist/window-tray@buschjaeger.github.io.shell-extension.zip
journalctl --user -f _COMM=gnome-shell | grep --line-buffered "Window Tray"
```

When reporting a bug, include the app's desktop ID
(`ls /usr/share/applications | grep -i <name>`) and the matching log lines.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome — especially version backports, packaging (Flathub, NixOS,
AUR), and tests for the app-matching logic.

## Origin

Built in a weekend to fix a workflow I disliked, with an AI assistant helping me
get past the Shell extension API learning curve. Everything is reviewed and
maintained by me. The genuinely subtle parts are app/WM-class matching, keeping
four activation paths distinguishable (dash click, external launcher
presentation, overview window activation, move-to-workspace keybinding), and the
PWA notification fallback.
